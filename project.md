# Main project

### Description and requirements

The goal of the main project is to develop an application or library
using the concepts and techniques introduced in the lectures. More
concretely, the project should:

* Be substantial: it should encompasse several thousands lines of code;
* Tackle a real-world scenario, that is, it should have a useful application;
* Illustrate that you know how to apply concepts and techniques for the lectures;
* In particular, use **strong types** to develop a *domain specific
  language* to solve a particular problem;
* Showcase the best development practices that you have learned,
  include testing, profiling, and project management.

### Deliverables

The project should be developed in teams of **three** people.

#### Project proposal -- due 20/2

The proposal is a 1 to 2-page document describing:

1. The domain you will be working on.
2. The problem or problems you library or application aims to solve.
3. An estimated schedule for the project.

#### Status report -- due 12/3

At the middle of the period you have to hand in a report (1 to 2 pages) describing the current status of your project:

1. A concise description of the main data types and techniques you are using.
   * Include a description of any libraries you are using.
2. What you have achieved so far -- a brief summary of what has been implemented.
   * Please include a link to the repository containing the code.
3. Timeline -- are you still on track? How will you adapt your original timeline?

#### Presentation and final submission -- due 5/4

Your final submission should contain the code and a small report
(around 5 pages) outlining:

1. A description of your domain and problem and how they translate to code.
2. The most important concept and techniques used throughout the code.
3. The results you have achieved, including examples of use of your
   library or application.
4. Reflection about what went well or better than expected, and what
   problems you encountered.

On 5/4 each team should prepare a small presentation (20 minutes,
including questions) to describe the highlights of the project -- both
in terms of functionality and techniques -- to the rest of the class.

### Suggested topics

A few ideas for possible topics are included below -- but this list is
by no means exhaustive:

* A task-oriented programming framework in the lines of
  [iTasks](https://clean.cs.ru.nl/ITasks).
* A library for describing spreadsheet calculations, and compute them.
* A Submit-like system with a webserver (maybe using
  [Servant](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant)) and a
  front-end (maybe using [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs)).
* A library for chemistry in the lines of
  [chemlab](http://chemlab.github.io/chemlab/), but strongly-typed.
* A library for data visualization and exploration;
* ...
