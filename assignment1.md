# Assignment 1 -- Smooth permutations

### Before you begin

We are using GitHub Classrooms for this assignment. Before you begin with the assignment, please link your GitHub account to the AFP classroom and create a repo for this assignment. You can do so by following [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/scD7K47R).

### Introduction

In this assignment we want to build a library to generate smooth permutations. Given a list of integers `xs` and an integer `d`, a _smooth permutation of `xs` with maximum distance `d`_ is a permutation in which the difference of any two consecutive elements is at most `d`.

A na√Øve implementation just generates all the permutations of a list,

```haskell
split []     = []
split (x:xs) = (x, xs) : [(y, x:ys) | (y, ys) <- split xs]

perms []     = [[]]
perms xs     = [(v:p) | (v, vs) <- split xs, p <- perms vs]
```

and then filters out those which are smooth,

```haskell
smooth n (x:y:ys) = abs (y - x) < n && smooth n (y:ys)
smooth _ _        = True

smoothPerms :: Int -> [Int] -> [[Int]]
smoothPerms n xs = filter (smooth n) (perms xs)
```

### Exercise 1 -- Packaging and documentation (10%)

1. Create a library `smoothies` which exports `perms` and `smoothPerms` from a module `SmoothPermsSlow`. You should be able to install the package by just running `cabal install` in it.
2. Document the exported functions using [Haddock](http://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Exercise 2 -- Testsuite (10%)

1. Write a `SmothPermsTest` module with a comprehensive set of properties to check that `smoothPerms` works correctly.
2. Integrate your testsuite with Cabal using `tasty` ([here is how you do so](https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty#project-organization-and-integration-with-cabal)).

### Exercise 3 -- Implementation with trees (30%)

The initial implementation of `smoothPerms` is very expensive. A better approach is to build a tree, for which it holds that each path from the root to a leaf corresponds to one of the possible permutations, next prune this tree such that only smooth paths are represented, and finally use this tree to generate all the smooth permutations from. Expose this new implementation in a new `SmoothPermsTree` module.

1. Define a data type `PermTree` to represented a permutation tree.
2. Define a function `listToPermTree` which maps a list onto this tree.
3. Define a function `permTreeToPerms` which generates all permutations represented by a tree.

    At this point the `perms` functions given above should be the composition of `listToPermTree` and `permTreeToPerms`.

4. Define a function `pruneSmooth`, which leaves only smooth permutations in the tree.
5. Redefine the function `smoothPerms`.

Integrate this module in the testsuite you developed in the previous exercise.

### Exercise 4 -- Unfolds (30%)

Recall the definition of `unfoldr` for lists,

```haskell
unfoldr :: (s -> Maybe (a, s)) -> s -> [a]
unfoldr next x = case next x of
                   Nothing     -> []
                   Just (y, r) -> y : unfoldr next r
```

We can define an unfold function for binary trees as well:

```haskell
data Tree a = Leaf a | Node (Tree a) (Tree a)
            deriving Show

unfoldTree :: (s -> Either a (s, s)) -> s -> Tree a
unfoldTree next x = case next x of
                      Left  y      -> Leaf y
                      Right (l, r) -> Node (unfoldTree next l) (unfoldTree next r)
```

Define the following functions in a new module `UnfoldUtils`, which should *not* be exposed by your package. Define the functions using `unfoldr` or `unfoldTree`, as required.

1. `iterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]`. The call `iterate f x` generates the infinite list `[x, f x, f (f x), ...]`.
2. `map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]`.
3. `balanced :: Int -> Tree ()`, which generates a balanced binary tree of the given height.
4. `sized :: Int -> Tree Int`, which generates any tree with the given number of nodes. Each leaf in the returned tree should have a unique label.

Define a new module `SmoothPermsUnfold` with an `unfoldPermTree` function which generates a `PermTree` as defined in the previous exercise. Then use that `unfoldPermTree` to implement a new version of `listToPermTree` and `smoothPerms`.

### Recap of modules

By the end of exercise 4, you should have a package with the following modules:

* `SmoothPermsSlow`, exposed, with the initial slow implementation.
* `SmoothPermsTest`, which contains the QuickCheck tests.
* `SmoothPermsTree`, exposed, with the `PermsTree`-based implementation.
* `UnfoldUtils`, hidden.
* `SmoothPermsUnfold`, exposed, with the `unfold`-based implementation.

### Exercise 5 -- Proofs (20%)

Write the following proofs as comments in the `UnfoldUtils` module.

1. Prove using induction and equational reasoning that the version of `map` you defined using `unfoldr` coincides with the definition of `map` by recursion.
2. We define the `size` of a binary tree as the number of internal nodes.

    ```haskell
    size (Leaf _)   = 0
    size (Node l r) = 1 + size l + size r
    ```

    What is the `size` of a balanced tree as generated by `balanced`? Prove your result using induction and equational reasoning.
